### Vault Structure

```
BookStack/
├── Attachments/
│   ├── gallery/          # Images
│   └── attachments/      # PDFs and other attachments
├── Book A/
│   ├── _index.md         # Book overview with links to chapters
│   ├── Page 1.md
│   └── Chapter X/
│       ├── _index.md     # Chapter overview with links to pages
│       └── Page 2.md
└── Book B/
    ├── _index.md
    └── Page 3.md
```

### Frontmatter

Every synced file automatically receives frontmatter metadata:

```yaml
---
bookstack_id: 42
bookstack_type: page
bookstack_updated_at: "2026-04-03T10:00:00Z"
bookstack_book_id: 5
bookstack_chapter_id: 12
---
```

### Navigation

Every synced page includes a navigation line linking to the parent chapter/book and prev/next pages:

```
↑ [[Chapter/_index|Chapter Name]] · ← [[Previous Page]] · → [[Next Page]]
```

Index files (`_index.md`) are generated for each book and chapter, providing a table of contents with wikilinks to all pages.

### Conflicts

When a page has been changed both locally and in BookStack:

- **Ask** (default): A modal shows both versions side by side. You decide: *Keep Local*, *Keep Remote*, or *Skip*.
- **Local wins**: The local version is automatically pushed to BookStack.
- **Remote wins**: The BookStack version overwrites the local file.

For multiple simultaneous conflicts, a batch modal appears with per-file options.

### Deletions

Deleted pages are detected and presented to the user for confirmation — nothing is ever deleted automatically. Options per file:

- **Delete** — Delete on the other side as well
- **Keep (unlink)** — Keep the file/page but remove it from sync
- **Skip** — Do nothing

## Conversion

### BookStack → Obsidian (HTML → Markdown)

- BookStack callouts (`info`, `warning`, `danger`, `success`) → Obsidian callouts (`> [!info]`)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting are preserved
- Internal BookStack links → Obsidian `[[Wikilinks]]` (if target page is synced)
- BookStack drawings → Placeholder with link to original
- Tables with colspan/rowspan → Markdown table with warning comment
- GFM: Tables, strikethrough, task lists

### Obsidian → BookStack (Markdown → HTML)

- Full Markdown support via `marked` library (tables, footnotes, nested lists, etc.)
- Obsidian callouts → BookStack callout classes
- Wikilinks → BookStack internal links
- Local images → BookStack Image Gallery URLs
- Image upload — local images are uploaded to BookStack Image Gallery, with de-duplication
